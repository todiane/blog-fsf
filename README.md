## Personal Website

This blog platform was created in September 2023 as part of my full-stack developer training.

In February 2024 I decided to add a homepage to it and turn it into my personal website with a blog.

The site was created using Django and Bootstrap and is deployed with Heroku. Live link is

Images are hosted at Cloudinary

Database is hosted with ElephantSQL

At the time of creating this blog I have left off the comments section so the CRUD functionality hasn't been completed for users/readers.

I may add it at a later date but for now I am moving on to creating my own project 4 which is the next one due in.

I will be using Django and Bootstrap again.
