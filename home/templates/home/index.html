            What is digital commerce and how does it differ to ecommerce?
          </p>
          <p>
            <p>Digital commerce, in its simplest terms, is the buying and selling of goods and services through digital channels.
                With the majority of people glued to their phones,
                websites optimised for phone use and dedicated apps
                allow businesses to tap into the vast market of mobile users.
